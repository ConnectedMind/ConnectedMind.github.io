I needed a way to chronicle and showcase a growing list of projects for 25x52. Based on some quick research, Jekyll seemed like a good solution especially since my projects are hosted on Github.

Except I didn&rsquo;t know Jekyll.

And all the Jekyll templates I found were either ugly or ill-suited since they were mostly intended to be blog clones.

So, out of necessity, I needed to make my own. And you&rsquo;re looking at it.
